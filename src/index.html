  PROJECT REQUIREMENTS BELOW:

  Grading:

  1. Push your final version to the gh-pages branch of your repo.  Your repo should be inside the cohort's orgnaization and name "Sean-Johnson-bookmarks-app"
  2. Add the live GH pages link to the header of your repo.
  3. Create a README.md file that contains a full list of all user stories completed.
  4. Submit the repo URL at the bottom of this page.

  User Stories:
  
  1. I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list.  Bookmarks contain: title, url link, description, rating (1-5).
  2. I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app.
    --All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating.
  3. I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view.
    --Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link.
  4. I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list.
  5. I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark.
    --Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. "title" and "url" field required).
  6. I can select from a "dropdown" (a <select> element) a minimum rating to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection.
  7. (Extension feature - optional) - I can edit the rating and description of a bookmark in my list.

  Technical Requirements:

  1. Use "fetch" for AJAX calls and JQuery for DOM manipulation
  2. Use namespacing to adhere to good architecture practices
    --Minimum global variables.
    --Create modules in separate files to organize your code
    --Logically group your functions (e.g. API methods, store methods...).
  3. Keep your Data out of the DOM.
    --No direct DOM manipulation in your event handlers.
    --Follow the React-ful design pattern - change your state, re-render your component.
  4. Use semantic HTML.
  5. Use a responsive and mobile-first design.
    --Visually and functionally solid in viewport for mobile and desktop.
  6. Follow a11y best practices.
