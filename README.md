This is the bookmark app that I have created.  

This app allows users to quickly access their favorite websites. In creating this application, I utilized Thinkful's API to create, delete, and post bookmark items. Rather than writing directly in the HTML file, I chose to use template-generation functions to render the HTML at different screens. The page screens were rendered through jQuery using DOM traversal and manipulation. 

Please see user stories below:

-Users can add bookmarks to their personalized list. Each bookmark contains: url link, title, description, rating (1-5 stars).

-Users see a list of condensed bookmark items showing only the title and rating when they open the application.

-Users can click on a bookmark to display an expanded view containing additional details.  

-Users can remove bookmarks from their list by clicking on "Delete" within the expanded view.

-Users will receive an error message if they have not submitted all of the required details within the "Add Bookmark" page.

-Users can filter on the main page by a minimum rating and only bookmarks at, or above that rating will render to the page.

This application was very fun to build and I hope you enjoy the experience of keeping your favorite bookmarks in one place!
